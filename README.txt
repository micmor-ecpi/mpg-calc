# Project Name: MPG Calculator (MPG-Calc)

## Project Description
This project is a comprehensive exploration of fundamental programming concepts and software development practices. The goal is to create a small, functional application that demonstrates proficiency in coding, collaboration, and version control using GitHub. For my project I have chosen to create a small gas mileage calculator that takes in user data for a fill-up, and stores it in a database. In addition to storing the user data in the database, the second and onward receipts will generate an MPG readout and total price on the new receipt.

## Project Tasks
- **Task 1: Set up the development environment**
  - Install necessary software and tools
  - Configure Git and GitHub repository
- **Task 2: Plan the project**
  - Define the project scope and objectives
  - Create a timeline and assign roles
- **Task 3: Implement core features**
  - Develop the main functionalities of the application
  - Write clean and efficient code
- **Task 4: Test the application**
  - Perform unit and integration testing
  - Debug and fix issues
- **Task 5: Document the project**
  - Create a comprehensive README file
  - Write user and developer documentation
- **Task 6: Finalize and submit**
  - Review and refine the project
  - Submit the final version on GitHub

## Project Skills Learned
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Project planning and task management
- Software development and debugging
- Writing documentation

## Language Used
- **C#**: Chosen for its simplicity through console IO, it is a great choice for a simple program that only needs to take in data and perform basic calculations.

## Development Process Used
- **Agile Methodology**: Emphasizing iterative development, continuous feedback, and collaboration.
